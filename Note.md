这是一个无人车问题和方法的描述文件
This is a file describing the self-driving problem and its methods.
The problem:
One or multiple self-driving cars from their original positions to their destinations. At the same time, no crash between each other, no crash between cars and pedestrians, no crash cars and road edges, compliance with traffic regulations are also required.
